    A 'patient monitoring exception' is a waiver on the regular monitoring of a
    patient. While a patient monitoring exception is in effect the system will
    not enforce observations on a patient in the usual way as there is some
    reason why the patient cannot be or should not be monitored.

    Patient monitoring exceptions are implemented as activity data related to
    an activity. When the activity is 'started' then the patient monitoring
    exception is in effect. When the activity is 'completed' then the patient
    monitoring exception ceases and normal monitoring resumes.
