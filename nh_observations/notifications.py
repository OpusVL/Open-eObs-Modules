`notifications.py` defines a set of activity types to serve as
informative reminders for the users that some action needs to take
place. They usually don't represent an action themselves.
A complete notification means the notification was read and the action
it refers to was done.
The abstract definition of a notification from which all other
notifications inherit is also included here.
